# Music J2EE Application

A Java EE web application for managing music-related data (artists, albums, tracks, users) built using the J2EE platform.

## Project Overview

This project aims to deliver a web-based system for managing music catalogues — including CRUD operations for artists, albums, tracks, and user sessions. It’s built on J2EE standards and demonstrates typical enterprise web-application patterns such as servlets, JSP, MVC, and a relational database backend.

## Features

* User login / authentication (basic)
* Management of Artists: add/update/delete/view
* Management of Albums: associate with artists, manage album data
* Management of Tracks/Songs: associate with albums, manage metadata
* Web front-end UI using JSP/HTML/CSS for users to interact with the catalogue
* Data persistence with relational database (MySQL or similar)
* Build automation with Ant (via `build.xml`)

## Technology Stack

* Java (J2EE / Java EE)
* Servlets & JSP
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Database: MySQL (or another relational DB)
* Build tool: Apache Ant (`build.xml`)
* Project structure: NetBeans-style (`nbproject` folder)

## Architecture & Folder Structure

```
/src              – Java source code (servlets, models, controllers)
/web              – Web content: JSP pages, CSS, JavaScript, images
/build            – compiled output
/nbproject        – NetBeans project files
/build.xml        – Ant build script
```

The architecture follows a model-view-controller (MVC) pattern: servlets act as controllers, JSP as views, and Java classes as models/data access.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dilshan-Wickramasinghe/Music-J2EE-Application.git  
   ```
2. Import the project into your IDE (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse) as a Java EE/Web application.
3. Configure the database:

   * Create a database (e.g., `musicdb`).
   * Create tables for Artists, Albums, Tracks, Users (you may need to write the SQL if not provided).
   * Update DB connection settings in your code (e.g., `DBConfig.java`, `web.xml`, or a properties file).
4. In your app server (e.g., Apache Tomcat, GlassFish):

   * Deploy the web application (WAR) generated by the build (via Ant or IDE).
   * Ensure the server supports servlets/JSP and the JDBC driver is configured.
5. Access the application:

   * Open your browser and navigate to the deployed URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/MusicJ2EEApplication`).
   * Log in (if default credentials exist) or register a new user.

## Usage

* **Manage Artists**: As an admin/authorized user, you can add new artists, edit artist details (name, biography, image), and delete artists if needed.
* **Manage Albums**: Link albums to artists; manage release date, genre, cover art.
* **Manage Tracks**: Link tracks to albums; define track name, duration, order, maybe upload audio file or link.
* **Browse Catalogue**: Users can browse the list of artists → albums → tracks, see details, maybe play a sample (if implemented).
* **User Roles**: Depending on implementation, you may have admin vs regular user roles; adjust accordingly.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you’d like to improve the system:

2. Create a new branch (`feature/your-feature`).
3. Make your changes with clear commit messages.
4. Submit a pull request describing your changes.
5. Please ensure any new features are tested and code is clean + documented.
